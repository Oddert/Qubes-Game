          <p>In a time of rising prison population, deteriorating conditions and health, and the host of problems which feed into loops of deprivation and crime.</p>
          <p>Extending the category of Social Games, <%= game_name %> was inspired by Captivated, a project South Denmark University’s Social Games Against Crime team which sought to tackle the same issue of parental alienation in prison.</p>

          <h4>1) Take</h4>
          <p>The game works by players successively taking a brick out, without nocking the stack over.</p>
          <p>Players can use only one hand and cannot hold the stack, the player that crashes it loses all their points.</p>

          <p>The player picks a prompt, in one game mode the player answers the prompt themselves, in another you ask the next person and they respond.</p>

          <p>On successful answering of the question (judged by the consensus of the other players), the person receives in game currency, called ‘Squids’, corresponding with the colour / difficulty.</p>
          <p>If the player does not answer, they get no points and the round moves on. The player who pulled the brick must place it back on top, building a gradually more unstable stack until the game is over.</p>

          <p class="primary">It is no secret that the Prison system in the uk has much to improve, and often fails the ideal of rehabilitation. </p>
          <p class="primary">When opportunities are missing and rehabilitation is not an option, incarceration can feed into a vicious cycle of crime, anti-social behaviour and derivation.</p>
          <p>One key area identified as being a major component in this was the role of relationships between incarcerated fathers and their children. Children and adolescents with stronger connections to their parents are far less likely to suffer health issues, do well in school and avoid crime than those who’s relationship breaks down.</p>
          <p>In their younger years, kids will be brought to visit with relatives, as adults they understand the importance of visiting themselves. Its in their teen years that people begin to drift apart and people stop visiting.</p>
          <!-- <p>Captivated was a project led by social designers Eva Knutz and Thomas Markussen of The Social Games against Crime at South Denmark University, which successfully sought to tackle this issue through a Social Game.</p> -->
          <!-- <p>With the stark differences between Danish and UK prisons and society, <%= game_name %> sought to replicate this success and make something uniquely suited to the UK prison system.</p> -->
          <p><%= game_name %> was designed in response to this issue: <strong>How can we, assuming no radical change in incarceration trends, help incarcerated fathers reconnect and maintain connections with their children on the outside.</strong></p>

        <h2>Social Penetration Theory | The Onion Theory</h2>
        <p>Social Penetration Theory, often referred to as The Onion Theory, is a theory of interpersonal communication and relationship that seeks to describe how relationships move from weak and relatively shallow, to deeper and more intimate connections.</p>
        <p>Onion theory proposes that relationship development occurs primarily thorough self-disclosure and intentionally revealing personal information. Through this, relationships move between ‘layers’ of deepness or intimacy. Likewise, as individuals grow apart, they move ‘back up’ through the layers as the personal information they once shared is no longer accurate / meaningful.</p>
        <p>The metaphor of an onion is used to describe these levels and the ‘jumping’ between layers that occurs.</p>

        <p><%= game_name %> uses the Onion Theory as a method of promoting the building and strengthening relationships.</p>
        <p>Its questions are ordered with diffirent colours and points by where they fall on this superficial-deep scale, superficial questions receive few points while deeper questions have more.</p>
        <p>This balance of physical tension, points motivating players to tackle more difficult subjects, allows the gameplay to prompt users to move between them as necessary.</p>
